# Running Code
The DetectorDetective.ipynb consists of codes to generate all the visualizations needed. Make sure to give an appropriate path name in the file to download the visualizations.
Datasets folder should have "coco" which in turn should have "annotations" (.json file) and "val2017" (images) 

streamlit run streamlit_visualization.py 

The above command with addresses pointing to the saved image directory should be enough to open the app locally.
